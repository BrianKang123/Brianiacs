                Final Project Proposal:
                Monopoly Control
For our final project, we want to recreate the classic board game Monopoly.
Purpose of Game: Earn money, don’t get bankrupt and grow your business!
Players/ Characters: 1 Player and 3 AI (Programmed Gamers)
Amount: Players starts off with $1500 per player
Classes Incorporated: Chance - The luck of the player
            Chest - The different possible rewards given to the player
            Property - What type of land you own
            Special Corner Pieces - Attributes to the board based on your location
AI involvement: The AI will make decisions based on their threshold of balance and the cost of the property, for example the AI will not buy the property if the property is a certain percentage of its total balance.. Additionally, it will be based on how much of the same set the AI has of the property, attempting to acquire a monopoly due to the added benefits of owning an entire set.

Game Progression: The players will get a random number between 2 to 12 and move the corresponding steps. The player spends or accumulates their money by acquiring properties, paying or collecting rent and acting based on the luck of their chests or chances. Every full lap, the player gets a certain amount of money.

How to Win: Be the last player standing, which means that you are the only one with money left.

Our vision: Our vision for this final project is to resourcefully use all the information we learned about randomization, money transactions, classes and inheritance, arrays, loops, and more to incorporate it in a money business orientated game, which led us to monopoly.

Note: Rules of our game will follow the official rules, with as little deviation as possible. However, due to the limitations of what we learned, we may omit some aspects of the game, whether it be because of our ability, convenience, or balance.
